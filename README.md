This repository contains C programs developed as part of the Operating Systems Laboratory course.
The programs demonstrate fundamental operating system concepts such as memory management, process scheduling, paging, disk scheduling, file allocation, synchronization, and UNIX system calls.

All programs are written in C language and are suitable for academic and laboratory practice.
